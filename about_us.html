            <h2>Our Beginnings</h2>
            <p>Founded by UNC alumni Maegan Clawges, Pearl Hacks was first held in 2014 as one of the only
                beginner-friendly hackathons targeted towards women at the time. It was organized in response to the
                boom in college hackathons, where students got to spend a weekend bringing their technological ideas to
                life with the help of their peers and industry professionals. But while those hackathons were great at
                immersing students into tech, it was clear that the gender gap and the often intimidating environment at
                those events was stopping a lot of women of all skill levels from signing up. The first Pearl Hacks
                brought in 250 female highschool and college students in the hopes of providing them with a great
                hackathon experience that sidestepped these issues. </p>

            </div>
            <p>By growing and learning from the last four years of Pearl Hacks (which has nearly tripled in size), we
                now strive to be an open and inclusive environment for gender minorities to experience hackathons, and
                hopefully dive deeper into the world of technology after experiencing a weekend with us. </p>
            <p>First-timers are welcomed to join no matter their level of experience. All that awaits you is a weekend
                of meeting amazing people, learning about technology, and free swag and prizes. We hope you join us at
                this wonderful event! </p>
